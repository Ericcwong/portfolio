        <p> Hello, my name is Eric Wong and welcome to my portfolio. I am an 22 year old student who is attending the University of Utah coding bootcamp. This portfolio will display all the works that I have done through out the coding bootcamp
           If you have any questions about my work or contacting, click on the Contact tab and send me an email. I will try to respond within a day.   
        </p>
        <p>A little bit about myself. I am the youngest in my family of 5 children. My parents own a chinese restaurant called Enjoy Chinese Cuisine. If I somehow find spare time in between being an uncle, working, and school, I like to play video games with friends. 
           The main game I play is League of Legends so if you do play, we would have to play together sometime!
